# flutter_navigator_example

The demo app from the course "The Complete 2021 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart" by Dr. Angela Yu did not run due to Flutter SDK and Dart Language changes.
Here is the original project: https://github.com/londonappbrewery/Navigation-Flutter-Demo
This project is based on the .dart files having been copied across to a black Flutter project.
